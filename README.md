## Lejr
This repository contains the CalHacks 6.0 prototype Android app for Lejr. The app leverages the idea of a community ledger in the context of a shared apartment or other living space. The goal is to provide an easy way to keep track of individual contributions, such as groceries, and calculate how much each person owes each other. This encourages individuals to make contributions in order to gain a net positive on the community ledger. Members of the community can then at a later date settle their debts, i.e. individuals who are net negative can directly pay those who are net positive. This app was built with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and uses Google Cloud Platform services to perform text recognition on receipts ([Google ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit)) and store user data ([Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)).

## Official Project Details
I am currently exploring using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to rebuild the app. More details to follow.
