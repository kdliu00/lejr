## Lejr
This repository contains the CalHacks 6.0 prototype Android app for Lejr, built with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Lejr leverages the idea of a community ledger in the context of a shared apartment or other living space. The goal is to provide an easy way to keep track of individual contributions, such as groceries, and calculate how much each person owes each other. This encourages individuals to make contributions in order to gain a net positive on the community ledger. Members of the community can then at a later date settle their debts, i.e. individuals who are net negative can directly pay those who are net positive. The prototype uses [Google ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) to perform text recognition on receipts and [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to store user data.

## React Native
I am currently rebuilding the app using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
